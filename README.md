# **Travel algorithms:**

##### A series of algorithms using different techniques to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem.

Todo: Update greedy.py with optimization, DP techniques

**V2:** Scores must be incorrect, need to examine borrowed code and current strategy for calculation of path cost.

**V1:** Currently this program calculates the shortest path through a Graph in graph.py using brute-force, while Greedy techniques are in development. Greedy/brute only output paths, need clean-up and actual scores.
